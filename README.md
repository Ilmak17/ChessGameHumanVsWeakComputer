# Console Chess Game

This is a simple chess game that allows a human player to play against a weaker computer opponent in a console environment.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: When you run the program, the chessboard will appear in the console. Each square on the board is represented by letters and numbers (e.g., `a1`, `b8`), following standard chess notation.

2. **Turn-based Play**: The game is set up for **human vs. computer** play. The human player and the computer take turns making moves. The computer opponent is designed to play at a beginner level, making it a suitable challenge for new players.

3. **Options**:
    - **Make a Move**: The human player enters moves in chess notation (e.g., `e2 to e4`), while the computer calculates its response after each move.
    - **Offer a Draw**: The human player can offer a draw if they believe the game is balanced or they want to end it.
    - **Give Up**: The human player can resign if they feel they cannot win the game.

4. **Display**: The board updates after each move, showing the current positions of all pieces and indicating whose turn it is.
